## Answer to the  questions 

1. The fastest algorithm out of bucket sort and quick sort is quick sort having a average time complexity of nlogn.
2. The entry point of the application is 
- NameSpace SortComplarision
- Class Program
- Method name is static void main() 
3. The file name that displays the main form is frmMain.cs
4. The constructor call for the main form is InitializeComponent
5. The main form is derived from the Form class using the inheritance concept.

6. The default value should be between Maximum and Minimum values, hence the IDE shows an error if it is not.
7. this.cboAlg1.SelectedIndex=3, this command is used to set the default value to Bucket sort.
8. this.cboAlg1.SelectedIndex=12, this command is used to set the default value to Quick sort.
10. InitializeOutputFolder() is used to return the base directory where program.cs exists.
11. this.cmdShuffle is the function in frmMain.cs used to shuffle the values to be sorted and performClick() method is used to derive a click event.
12. this.cmdSort.ForeColor = Color.BlueViolet;
13. this.cmdShuffle.BackColor = Color.Chocolate;
